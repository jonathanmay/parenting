Lisa encourages a connection-based approach that's in sync with your child's needs and development. Rather than sticking to a strict schedule, her method focuses on recognising the child's cues and fostering a sense of security, helping to minimise anxiety and potential aggressive behaviours. Adaptable to your current situation and pressures as well, this understanding, hands-on approach could be a lifesaver as you guide your little ones through transitions such as toilet training or starting school.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Intuitive Weaning, Early Childhood Development, Transitions and Changes. | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://thenaturalparentmagazine.com/intuitive-weaning-a-kind-supportive-connection-based-approach-to-weaning/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://www.attachmentmummy.com/2025/06/rose-petal-soup-sensory-play-activity.html' target='_blank'>Rose Petal Soup Sensory Play Activity Kids Will Love #rosepetalsoup #summer #kidsactivities #montessori #waldorf #preschool #outdoorplay #homeschooling #homeeducation</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Attachment Mummy – 2025-06-23</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>For a calming, budget-friendly, and delightful sensory activity, consider concocting a simple 'rose petal soup'. Sensory play is a crucial aspect of early childhood development, and this gentle, creative exploration combines nature with a little magic for your toddlers and preschoolers. Simply forage in the garden for rose petals and a few extra 'ingredients', pop them into a bowl, add water and let their imagination take flight. It's a lovely, mindful activity that encourages a connection with nature and can instill a sense of calming peace during playtimes.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Sensory Play, Nature Exploration, Mindful Activities | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://www.attachmentmummy.com/2025/06/rose-petal-soup-sensory-play-activity.html' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://handsonaswegrow.com/35-kid-activities-with-crayons/' target='_blank'>36 Things To Do with Crayons for Kids & Parents</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Hands On As We Grow – 2025-06-11</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>Toddlers and crayons are image bearers of creativity that fill our lives and homes with vibrant messes. Besides creating mini Monets, crayons can be an incredible tool for learning, playing and even cooling off tantrums. From using them in a scavenger hunt to expanding their vocabulary, from melting them into a colourful craft to using them as calm-down tools when aggression surges, these humble wax sticks can be your arsenal in gentle parenting. So roll up those sleeves, get your toddler’s favourite crayons out, and make your upcoming week colourful, fun, and educative all at once.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Creativity, Learning through play, Behavioural management. | Usefulness Score: 10</p><p><a href='https://handsonaswegrow.com/35-kid-activities-with-crayons/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://www.attachmentmummy.com/2025/06/how-to-find-best-homeschool-curriculum.html' target='_blank'>How to Find The Best Homeschool Curriculum for Your Family</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Attachment Mummy – 2025-06-19</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>With home-schooling, choosing the right curriculum can be daunting, but by focusing on the learning style and interests of your child, you’re already on the right path! Parents might need to experiment with different methods or materials, such as Montessori or nature-based curricula, to find what best stimulates curiosity and growth.

This isn't just another tick-tock time, it's a few dedicated precious moments, uninterrupted, laser-focused solely on our little tykes. As advised by 'The Natural Parent Magazine', these shared moments can effectively minimise the penchant our toddlers may have, for the ol' nibble and scratch routine, ease potty training worries, turn the school transition into a delightful jaunt and generally lessen the aggressive moments. Exquisite, we hear you say, well, indeed it appears so! Set a timer, keep promises, embrace their choices, and delve wholeheartedly into your child's world.

Such well-worn myths can actually cause unnecessary stress for both parents and children. Remember, every child is unique with individual needs. Rather than abruptly removing such comforts, taking a gentle approach to transitions may be more beneficial for your child's development. Instead of focusing on strict timelines, track your child's personal progress and inspire confidence in their own abilities — be it moving to a big bed, starting school, or managing emotions like biting or scratching.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Gentle Parenting, Night-Time Nursing, Child's Sleep, Emotional Management | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://thenaturalparentmagazine.com/your-baby-does-not-need-to-stop-nursing/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://www.madeformums.com/baby/what-is-heat-rash/' target='_blank'>Heat Rash: Causes, symptoms and effective treatments</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>MadeForMums – 2025-06-19</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>In this cheery yet practical MadeForMums article, a seasoned GP shares tips for recognising, treating and preventing heat rash in our little darlings, as well as advice on when it's time to ring the doctor. Key indicators to look out for include small red spots, often around the neck, shoulders and chest. The GP advises cool baths, loose clothing and strategic heat dodging to manage the condition, and to ring a GP if there are symptoms of fever or if the rash persists for a few days.

According to experts, this should also apply on holiday, with only 20% of parents giving teens their own space. Parents tend to feel teens would adhere to rules (64%) if given more freedom, but concerns about safety loom large. It’s about balance: teaching them responsibility, addressing our natural fears as parents, and guiding them controls their influences.
