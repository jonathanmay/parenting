Using a ruler as a prop, she cleverly navigated a roleplay scenario teaching her child how to introduce unfamiliar friends. The 'ruler introduction', provides a physical embodiment of connections and spaces. One hand represents one friend, the other, a new acquaintance, and the ruler signifies the bridge between them. This seemingly simple tactic fosters social skills, encourages empathy, and could notably ease the challenging transition to preschool or reception. Definitely a hack worth trying, making your little one the politest, most considerate individual at their next gathering.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Role-play as a learning technique, building social skills, easing transition to school. | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://www.mother.ly/news/moms-ruler-trick-teaches-social-skills/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://www.janetlansbury.com/2025/06/how-to-handle-our-kids-obsessive-jealousy/' target='_blank'>How to Handle Our Kids’ Obsessive Jealousy</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Janet Lansbury – 2025-06-08</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>Parenting young 'uns can be quite the roller-coaster ride, what with all their emotions running high.

You're not alone. This week we're reviewing advice from parenting expert Janet Lansbury who has been supporting a single mum with her expressive 2.5-year-old. Sometimes, our tots can be the sweetest angels but when their wills are thwarted, their reactions can be jarring - think casting toys, shouting, and flaps of frustration. Janet highlights the importance of staying calm, firm boundaries and lots of love. Remember, their emotions are just as real as ours, even if they are over not getting that 3rd biscuit.

The consensus? It's generally a good idea, as it helps your toddler learn maturity and improves their social skills. However, set boundaries and monitor their playtime to ensure they're not being negatively influenced or picked on. Engage your child in conversations about their experiences and teach them how to respect others. When it comes to aggression like biting or scratching, redirect their energy into constructive behaviours. Ahead of school transitions, teaching patience and embracing change will ease anxiety and set them up for success.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Older Playmates, Aggression Management, School Transitions. | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/should-i-let-my-kindergartener-play-with-older-kids' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://thenaturalparentmagazine.com/your-baby-does-not-need-to-stop-nursing/' target='_blank'>Your baby does not need to stop nursing</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>The Natural Parent Magazine – 2025-06-19</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>Lauren Heffernan, in The Natural Parent Magazine, reassures parents that there's no need to stop your baby from nursing to sleep, it's perfectly normal and won't impede their ability to sleep through the night.

Janet Lansbury suggests we might unknowingly be making three common errors: we might be trying to stop behaviour without understanding its root cause; we're setting boundaries but not ensuring they're comprehensible or enforceable; or we're losing our cool when things don't go to plan. Instead, she advises seeking to comprehend why the behaviour is happening, making sure our set boundaries are comprehensible and achievable, and quite crucially, maintaining our own calm.
