She describes familiar situations, such as inappropriate toy snatching, and highlights that losing our cool is not the answer. Instead, she recommends calmly acknowledging a child's feelings, but not indulging the jealousy itself. Scenario play and setting suitable boundaries can be beneficial. She also suggests pausing before intervening in sibling disputes, providing the children with time to develop their negotiation skills. This approach helps children better understand their feelings and become more self-reliant, thereby leading to peaceful resolutions.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Parenting strategies, dealing with jealousy, sibling rivalry, fostering self-reliance. | Usefulness Score: 8</p><p><a href='https://www.janetlansbury.com/2025/06/how-to-handle-our-kids-obsessive-jealousy/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://handsonaswegrow.com/12-garden-activities-kids/'>12 Garden Activities for Kids to Be Involved In</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Hands On As We Grow – 2025-06-18</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>This cheery article from Hands On As We Grow suggests a variety of delightful garden activities for your little ones to enjoy. Encouraging children to engage with the natural world can ease toddler aggression and replace biting/scratching behaviours with curiosity and exploration. Activities range from simple tasks like watering plants and creating dried flower arrangements, to slightly more complex ones, like growing their own produce or making a birdhouse. The great outdoors can also be used to prepare your tots for the transition to school, fostering independence, and providing a sensory-rich learning environment. Whether you've got a little space or a sprawling green, these ideas can be implemented this week to raise green-fingered kiddos.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Outdoor activities, behavioural improvements, school readiness preparation. | Usefulness Score: 9</p><p><a href='https://handsonaswegrow.com/12-garden-activities-kids/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://www.janetlansbury.com/2025/06/struggling-with-a-strong-willed-toddlers-tantrums/'>Struggling with a Strong-Willed Toddler’s Tantrums</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Janet Lansbury – 2025-06-08</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>Chin up, parents! Janet Lansbury shares insights on managing spirited toddlers' tantrums, crucial for those blessed with feisty little ones. A mum of a two-and-a-half-year-old is concerned about her darling's aggressive behaviours– getting physical and raising the decibels when denied her desires. Janet's advice? Firstly, keep calm – your composed manner will help soothe their heated flares. Next, affirm their feelings. It's alright for them to express disagreement and frustration. Lastly, assert boundaries and don't shy away from saying "no". It's not always easy, but this approach can make transitions to school smoother. Remember, it's all learning and growing - for both of you.</p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#888;'>Themes: Toddler aggression, Behaviour management, Transition to school. | Usefulness Score: 8</p><p><a href='https://www.janetlansbury.com/2025/06/struggling-with-a-strong-willed-toddlers-tantrums/' style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;color:#0066cc;text-decoration:none;'>Read more →</a></p></div><div style='border-top:1px solid #e0e0e0;padding-top:20px;margin-top:20px;'><h3 style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:18px;color:#0066cc;margin:0 0 10px;'><a href='https://handsonaswegrow.com/35-kid-activities-with-crayons/'>36 Things To Do with Crayons for Kids & Parents</a></h3><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;color:#555;margin:0 0 5px;'><em>Hands On As We Grow – 2025-06-11</em></p><p style='font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:15px;line-height:1.6;color:#333;'>Scribbling away with crayons can be so much more than just colouring; it’s an opportunity for artistry, creativity, play, and even learning.

Embracing the role, men have learned to juggle nappies, meltdowns, and storytimes with admirable grace while deciphering the tricky worlds of toddler aggression and preschooler transitions.
